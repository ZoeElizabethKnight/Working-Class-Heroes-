<p> The British economy began to change from agricultural to industrial in the the 18th century, driven by materials such as iron and steel. </p>

<p> Sheffield was ideally located for these businesses to thrive due to the local metal and coal reserves, and the water supply from the valleys and River Don. </p>


<p> Sheffield became world renowned particularly for its steel production, Metalworking in the city dates back over 700 years, most notably for its craft of cutlery - as referenced in Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales. </p>

<section class="content">

  <p> Throughout the 1600 and 1700s, Sheffield became a hub for innovations in steelwork. In 1742, clockmaker Benjamin Huntsman invented the crucible steel process and became the first person to cast steel ingots. </p>


<p> Up until this point, the quality of steel produced had largely been unreliable, but Huntsman’s invention changed steelmaking forever. Higher quality steel could be made in larger quantities - production rose from 200 tons a year to over 20,000 and formed 40% of total steel production in Europe a century later. </p>


<p> The industry continued to prosper into the city into the 1900s, and the city’s success was only heightened with the discovery of stainless steel by Dr Harry Brearley in 1913. Stainless steel remains the most commonly used alloy of its type internationally to this day. </p>

  <p> Although Sheffield experienced a economic boom in the early 1900s up until the end of the First World War due to the innovations in steel productions and the munitions industry, but by 1920, Britain had fallen into a post-war slump, and employment rose exponentially. </p>


<p> This was only exacerbated by the global Great Depression beginning following the Wall Street Crash in 1929. Unemployment peaked in the North-East of England at 28.5% in 1932. </p>


<p> In 1921, in response to the national economic crisis, the recently formed British Communist Party set up the National Unemployed Workers’ November (NUWN). The charismatic leader of the NUWM, Wal Hannington, began organising marches of the unemployed on Parliament, beginning in 1922 and stretching well into the 1930s. </p>


<p> These demonstrations were commonly known as ‘hunger marches’ and perhaps the most famous was the Jarrow March. The protest began in the Tyneside town, with unemployed joining from many industrial towns and cities along the way, including Sheffield. </p>

      <p> Around 200 hundred unemployed reached Parliament on October 31 after a 26 day march, to demonstrate against the widespread poverty in declining industrial areas, predominantly in the North East of England and southern Wales. </p>


<p> A study by Wal Hannington in 1936 revealed epidemics of rickets and tuberculosis as a result of malnourishment in what Conservative ministers were calling ‘famine areas’. Populations in these regions decreased by an average of 10% due to extreme poverty, and the Tories tried to force people to emigrate out - a notion the NUWN strongly opposed. </p>


<p> Sheffield was fundamental to the arming of the British military during both world wars bringing a modicum of stability to the working-class. Weapons and munitions manufacture continued until the late 1960s. However, Sheffield suffered in the 1970s when demand began to drop and many of the steelworks began to close. </p>

      <p> The coal mining industry became the only saving grace for the working class in Sheffield, but this was short-lived. In the 1980s, unemployment and deprivation were rife. </p>


<p> Tensions peaked with a violent clash at the Orgreave coking site near Rotherham in 1984, in which many pickets and officers were injured. Many mines in South Yorkshire closed under Thatcher's Conservative government I'm the 1980s and 90s.  </p>


<p> To this day, Sheffield remains a vibrant hub of activism with protests in recent years covering everything from bus fare increases to tuition fee rises. Mostly recently, the Green party, the Make Votes Matter organisation, and their allies campaigned for Proportional Representation in February 2018. </p>
